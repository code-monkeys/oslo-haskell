Oslo-Haskell More Polymorphism meetup 2015-04-09
================================================
This repo contains the presentation and exercises relevant to the Oslo-Haskell
meetup on polymorphism: http://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Haskell/events/221411891/

The presentation is in pres.pdf.

For the exercises, start with Polymorphism.hs and continue to State.hs and/or
FoldAndTraverse.hs.

Replace all the 'todo's for great profit! HINT: comment out the 'todo'
declaration, compile the file & see all the compilations errors to find out
what exercises you have not completed yet. :-]


For more polymorphism theory and exercises, see the Typeclassopedia from the
Haskell wiki: https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia
